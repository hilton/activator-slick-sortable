<div>
  <h2>Tutorial overview</h2>

  <p>A web-based to-do list, for example, is a simple application with a tricky
  requirement: you want to be able to put the items in any order you like. With
  standard HTML interaction, this probably means awkward <em>Move Up</em> and
  <em>Move Down</em> buttons next to each item. Drag-and-drop is better for
  this.</p>

  <p><img src="tutorial/screenshot.png" alt="Tutorial application"></p>

  <p>The goal of this tutorial is to show you how to make a sortable list of
  animal names using a JavaScript library front-end and a Typesafe platform
  back-end.</p>

  <p>This tutorial shows you how to integrate the client, server and database
  components that you need to manually reorder a list, and persist changes.
  These components are:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://jqueryui.com/sortable/">jQuery UI Sortable</a> JavaScript
  client - handles user interaction and uses the server API</li>
  <li><a href="http://playframework.com/">Play Framework</a> server - renders
  the HTML view and provides the server-side API</li>
  <li><a href="http://slick.typesafe.com/">Slick</a> database mapping layer -
  saves changes to a database.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This tutorial demonstrates the simplicity of a Play Framework server API,
  and a straightforward Slick persistence layer. The result is little more than
  100 lines of Scala code, in an application structure that can scale up to a
  large but maintainable application.</p>
</div>


<div>
  <h2>Application structure</h2>

  <p>The application is uses the standard Play Framework application structure,
  with a JavaScript client.</p>

  <p><img src="tutorial/components.png" alt="Application components"></p>

  <p>The application fits together in the following order, starting with the
  data and adding the code that uses it.</p>

  <ol>
  <li>The <a href="#code/app/models/" class="shortcut"><code>models</code></a>
  package defines the domain model, which includes a database mapping and test
  data.</li>
  <li>The <a href="#code/app/controllers/" class="shortcut"><code>controllers</code></a>
  and <a href="#code/app/views/" class="shortcut"><code>views</code></a>
  packages provide the server-side web application that renders the data.</li>
  <li>The JavaScript code in
  <a href="#code/app/assets/" class="shortcut"><code>app/assets/</code></a>
  defines the client-side interaction.</li>
  <li>The <a href="#code/app/controllers/" class="shortcut"><code>controllers</code></a>
  package provides the API that the JavaScript client uses.</li>
  <li>The <a href="#code/app/models/" class="shortcut"><code>models</code></a>
  package persists changes in the database.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The rest of the tutorial will show you each of these, in turn. By seeing
  how each part works, you will be able to understand how they fit together.</p>

  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> it is also possible to start with the user interface
  and user interaction instead, and from there explore the API it uses and the
  API’s back-end. For now, let’s start with the data model.</p>
</div>


<div>
  <h2>Defining the data model</h2>

  <p>To make the data simpler than a to-do list, this example is just a fixed
  list of animal names. The data model consists of a single <code>Animal</code>
  entity, which has a name and a position in the list (starting at 1).</p>

  <p style="text-align:center"><img src="tutorial/model.png" alt="Domain model"></p>

  <p>The model is set-up in several steps.</p>

  <p><a href="#code/app/models/Animal.scala" class="shortcut">app/models/Animal.scala</a>
  defines an <code>Animal</code> case class for the domain model. Note that this
  model includes an <code>id</code> property, for the database primary key. We
  will return to the ‘data access functions’ in the companion object later.</p>

  <p><a href="#code/app/models/db/Animals.scala" class="shortcut">app/models/db/Animals.scala</a>
  defines the database model, as a Slick table mapping for the
  <code>Animal</code> case class. As you can see from the declarations of
  <code>position</code> and <code>positionIndex</code>, the
  <code>POSITION</code> column must contain a unique integer value. In the
  application code, we will further constrain these values to be consecutive,
  starting at 1.</p>

  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> note that the database table and attribute (column)
  names are defined in upper-case. This is because database identifiers are
  case-sensitive, and the H2 database emulates Oracle’s behaviour of
  transforming unquoted identifiers in SQL into upper case. This can result in
  unexpected runtime SQL errors like <em>Table "animals" not found</em> (because
  <code>create table animals</code> resulted in the table name
  <code>ANIMALS</code>).</p>

  <p><a href="#code/conf/evolutions/default/1.sql" class="shortcut">conf/evolutions/default/1.sql</a>
  is the Play evolutions file that contains the SQL DDL script to create the
  database, and create test data. You can write this script by hand or use Slick
  to generate the SQL create statements by inspecting
  <code>TableQuery[Animals].ddl.createStatements</code>. This requires a Slick
  database session in scope, so you could log this from one of the data access
  functions that you create later.</p>

  <p>To keep things simple for this tutorial, we use an in-memory
  <a href="http://www.h2database.com/">H2 database</a>, which is configured in
  <a href="#code/conf/application.conf" class="shortcut">conf/application.conf</a></p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Displaying the data</h2>

  <p>To display the data, this application uses a standard Play HTML template to
  to display the list of model objects returned by a single database query.</p>

  <p>To keep things simple for this tutorial, we use
  <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a> for the look-and-feel.
  This is also a good way to keep things simple for some real applications.</p>

  <p><a href="#code/app/models/Animal.scala" class="shortcut">app/models/Animal.scala</a>
  defines an <code>Animal</code> Scala object that contains data access methods.
  For displaying data, we only need <code>Animal.list</code>, which returns a
  sorted list of <code>models.Animal</code> instances.</p>

  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> always sort collections that will be displayed in the
  user interface, because ‘random order’ is probably not the most useful. If you
  have multiple query methods, then you can use a common base query for
  consistent ordering across queries, without code duplication:</p>

  <p><code>val sortedAnimals = animals.sortBy(_.position)</code></p>

  <p><a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.scala" class="shortcut">app/controllers/Application.scala</a>
  defines a trivial <code>index</code> controller action that renders the list
  of animals.</p>

  <p><a href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">app/views/index.scala.html</a>
  is the HTML template that renders the list of animals. The template’s
  <code>HEAD</code> section refers to several third-party resources made
  available via Webjars imports in
  <a href="#code/build.sbt" class="shortcut">build.sbt</a>:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>jQuery - JavaScript</li>
    <li>jQuery UI - JavaScript</li>
    <li>Twitter Bootstrap - CSS</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Otherwise, the template simply renders the <code>List[Animal]</code>
  parameter as an HTML list, using CSS classes for Twitter Bootstrap.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> the view includes a <code>span</code> for a
  Bootstrap ‘badge’ component that shows each animal’s position. This is not
  functionally necessary, but included here so you can see the position values
  in the user interface.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Adding client-side interaction</h2>

  <p>To focus on the server-side integration, this tutorial only has a
  simplistic JavaScript client, using a
  <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> component.</p>

  <p><a href="http://jqueryui.com/sortable/">jQuery UI Sortable</a> is a jQuery
  UI interaction that provides drag-and-drop support, for manually reordering
  web page elements. This is easy to set-up, but doesn’t solve the to-do list
  problem unless you can integrate it with a server-side API that will persist
  the changes.</p>

  <p><a href="#code/app/assets/sortable.js" class="shortcut">app/assets/sortable.js</a>
  consists entirely of initialising <code>sortable</code> jQuery plug-in on the
  HTML list, selected by ID. This code has two purposes:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>Visually indicate when dragging starts and stops.</li>
  <li>Send an HTTP PUT request to the server to reposition the list item.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The code sends the HTTP request using jQuery’s <code>ajax</code> function,
  which uses standard HTML form encoding to send the JavaScript object passed to
  the <code>data</code> parameter. In this case, this is more convenient than
  using JSON or XML, both on the client and on the server.</p>

  <p>What’s missing is proper error handling. For example, if the call to the
  server results in an error, it would be better to display a message and move
  the dragged item back to its original position, since the reordering was not
  successful. This is the kind of functionality provided by the DataTables
  <a href="https://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-row-reordering/wiki/Index">Row
  Reordering plugin</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> this JavaScript code mixes the interaction with the
  server and updates to the HTML, which makes the code shorter but harder to
  maintain. For a real application, it would be better to separate these
  concerns.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Defining the server API</h2>

  <p>For the client-side interaction to work, we have to define the server-side
  API for the ‘reposition item’ request. The client will use this API to update
  a position, giving the old position and the new position.</p>

  <p><a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">conf/routes</a> defines the
  HTTP API: an action that handles a PUT request for the <code>/position</code>
  resource. We use PUT because we are updating an existing resource. The client
  will send the old and new positions in the request body, so we don’t see these
  parameters declared here.</p>

  <p><a href="#code/app/controllers/Application.scala" class="shortcut">app/controllers/Application.scala</a>
  is the Play Framework controller that defines the <code>reposition</code>
  action that will handle the HTTP request. To keep the request data neat, this
  action uses a Play form mapping to map the form data in the request body to an
  instance of the <code>Position</code> case class.</p>

  <p>The form mapping uses the <code>min = 1</code> constraint to require
  positive numbers for positions; if the form data violates one of these
  constraints then binding the request data to the form will generate an error,
  and we will use Play’s <code>BadRequest</code> result to to generate a
  <em>400 Bad Request</em> HTTP response. Otherwise, we attempt to use the
  <code>Animal.reposition</code> data access function to reposition the item.</p>

  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> it isn’t always easy to see which kind of HTTP API
  will work best in a particular application. Sometimes the best thing to do is
  to try various options for whether to pass data in the URL path, query string
  or request body, for example, and see what results in the most elegant API and
  implementation.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <h2>Updating the saved position</h2>

  <p>Saving changes to an item’s position requires two database updates.</p>

  <ol>
  <li>The position of the moved item must be updated from the old position to
  the new position.</li>
  <li>All of the items between the old and new positions must be shifted up or
  down by one position.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><a href="#code/app/models/Animal.scala" class="shortcut">app/models/Animal.scala</a>
  includes the <code>Animal.reposition</code> function that performs the
  database update, using Slick. There are several parts to getting this right.</p>

  <p>First, updating the moved item’s position is split into two steps: its
  position is first set to -1. This is to avoid a unique constraint violation
  when shifting the intermediate items. The moved item’s final position is set
  last.</p>

  <p>Second, the three updates are wrapped in a transaction, so that all of them
  succeed or (if one fails) none of them succeed. This preserves data integrity.</p>

  <p>Finally, shifting the intermediate items up or down by one position turns
  out to be more tricky, which is why it’s extracted into a separate function.
  It turns out that the Slick DSL does not currently support this kind of
  relative update, like <code>set position = position + 1</code>. Updating
  multiple rows like this is also something that Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
  libraries cannot generally do either.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Slick supports native SQL using <code>StaticQuery</code>. This
  supports bind parameters with declared types, which allows the Scala API to
  remain type-safe.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> executing the update query returns the number of
  database rows updated. This is a good opportunity to check for error
  conditions, because invalid (out of range) positions will result in the wrong
  number of rows being updated, which allows us to cause this update to fail,
  and hence the whole reposition operation.</p>

  <p><strong>Advanced exercise:</strong> work out why the update in
  <code>shiftIntermediateItems</code> only works with the <code>MVCC=true</code>
  option on the database connection, configured in
  <a href="#code/conf/application.conf" class="shortcut">conf/application.conf</a>.
  Hint: one table, one transaction, three updates.</p>
</div>

  <h2>Next steps</h2>

  <p>Make this example production-ready, by improving the client side error
  handling and migrate the database configuration and SQL script to the database
  you use in production.</p>

  <p>This example used
  <a href="http://jqueryui.com/sortable/">jQuery UI Sortable</a> for ordering
  items in an HTML list. As an alternative, use
  <a href="https://datatables.net">DataTables</a> and the
  <a href="https://code.google.com/p/jquery-datatables-row-reordering/wiki/Index">Row
  Reordering plugin</a> for ordering rows in a table.</p>

  <p><a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> includes a number of other
  interactions and widgets. Try using the same approach to integrate them with
  a Play Framework server and a Slick peristence back-end. For example, use
  <a href="http://jqueryui.com/draggable/">jQuery UI Draggable</a> to allow the
  user to rearrange application interface elements, and make changes persistent.</p>
